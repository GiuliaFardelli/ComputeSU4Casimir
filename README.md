# ComputeCasimir

A Mathematica notebook for computing SU(4) Casimir operators acting on R-symmetry tensor structures in four-point functions  in $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills theory.

## Reference

This code was developed in support of the paper:

> **Rebooting quarter-BPS operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills**  
> Agnese Bissi, Giulia Fardelli, Andrea Manenti  
> *JHEP* (2022) · [arXiv:2111.06857 [hep-th]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06857)

The mathematical details underlying the construction — including the polarization formalism, the definition of the Casimir differential operators, and the tensor structure basis — are laid out in full in that paper, in particular in Section 2.3.

## Authors

The code was written by  **Andrea Manenti** and **Giulia Fardelli**.
